# üö® Incident Response Playbook

## üìñ Overview
This project provides a structured **Incident Response Playbook** for handling security incidents in **AWS cloud environments**. The playbook outlines best practices, response steps, and automation scripts for detecting, analyzing, and mitigating security incidents.

## üéØ Key Objectives
- Standardize the **incident response process** in cloud security environments.
- Provide **step-by-step response actions** for various attack scenarios.
- Integrate **AWS security tools** such as GuardDuty, CloudTrail, IAM, and Security Hub.
- Offer **automation scripts** to speed up incident detection and response.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies & Tools
- **AWS Security Services** (GuardDuty, CloudTrail, IAM, Security Hub)
- **SIEM solutions** (Splunk, ELK, AWS Security Hub)
- **Python & Shell scripting** (for automation)
- **Compliance frameworks** (NIST, CIS, ISO27001)

## üî• Playbook Scenarios
The playbook includes predefined response steps for the following **cloud security incidents**:

| Incident Type | Response Steps | Automated Actions |
|---|---|---|
| **Unauthorized IAM Role Change** | Identify changes, revoke suspicious access, review CloudTrail logs | Script to analyze IAM role modifications |
| **Compromised EC2 Instance** | Isolate instance, analyze logs, create snapshot for forensics | Script to quarantine EC2 instance |
| **S3 Bucket Data Breach** | Identify exposure, block public access, rotate IAM credentials | Automated security check for S3 |
| **Brute Force Attack on IAM User** | Detect failed login attempts, enforce MFA, block malicious IPs | Script to monitor CloudTrail authentication failures |
| **Malware Infection in AWS Lambda** | Scan for malicious code, rotate credentials, check outbound traffic | Security audit script for AWS Lambda |

## üìÇ Repository Structure
| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `/playbooks/incident_response_aws.pdf` | Full incident response guide for AWS security events |
| `/scripts/iam_role_checker.py` | Python script to detect unauthorized IAM role changes |
| `/scripts/ec2_quarantine.sh` | Shell script to isolate a compromised EC2 instance |
| `/scripts/s3_security_audit.py` | Python script to check S3 bucket security misconfigurations |
| `README.md` | Project documentation |

## üöÄ How to Use
1. **Download the playbook**: `/playbooks/incident_response_aws.pdf`
2. **Run security scripts** when an incident is detected:
   - Example: Isolate a compromised EC2 instance  
     ```bash
     ./scripts/ec2_quarantine.sh --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef
     ```
   - Example: Scan IAM roles for unauthorized changes  
     ```bash
     python scripts/iam_role_checker.py
     ```
3. **Integrate with AWS Security Hub** for automated alerts and response.
